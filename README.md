## Template Source

This portfolio site was built using the [CRA Template React Portfolio](https://github.com/codefellows/cra-template-react-portfolio). The template provided a solid foundation for the design and layout, allowing me to focus on customizing the content and tailoring it to reflect my skills and background.

I'd like to extend my appreciation to the creators of CRA Template React Portfolio for their excellent work, which significantly expedited the development process and contributed to the overall aesthetics of this portfolio.

Future versions of my portfolio site will be fully developed by me, but I opted for this template approach as more rapid deployment solution in the short term.

## Usage

Please note that this repository is for showcasing the portfolio website for Kyle Cordell, and is not intended to be run locally. Instead, you can explore the live version of the site by visiting the URL provided above.

While you can browse the code to gain insights into the implementation and customization of the template, keep in mind that the codebase is optimized for web deployment and may require additional configurations for local deployment.
